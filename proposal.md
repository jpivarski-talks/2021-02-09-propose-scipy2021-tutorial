## Short description

## Long description

### Draft schedule

**0:00-0:20 (20 min):** Introductory presentation: logistics, reminder of arraywise thinking in NumPy, and overview of data types in Awkward Array.

**0:20-0:40 (20 min):** Walk-through of exploratory data analysis (EDM) with the GeoJSON dataset. First with ufuncs and slices, then with Numba.

**0:40-1:00 (20 min):** All together (I ask questions, get responses in chat): exploratory analysis of the Exoplanets dataset.

**1:00-1:10 (10 min):** _(break)_

**1:10-1:20 (10 min):** Introduction to the Million Song dataset and example project questions (early, to get people thinking about it).

**1:20-1:40 (20 min):** Dealing with large-scale data: walk-through of LHC mass peaks (up to Higgs discovery).

**1:40-2:00 (20 min):** All together: analyzing the Argo Floats dataset, including some non-trivial manipulations at large-scale.

**2:00-2:10 (10 min):** Break-out into small groups, including the logistics of finding people to work on the same projects together.

**2:10-3:30 (1 hour, 20 min):** Small groups work on their chosen Million Song projects. I cycle through break-out rooms to check on them, prioritizing any "calls for help."

**3:30-4:00 (30 min):** Each group informally demonstrates what they've accomplished.
