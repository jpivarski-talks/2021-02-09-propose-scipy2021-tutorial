### Draft schedule

**0:00-0:20 (20 min):** Introductory presentation: logistics, reminder of arraywise thinking in NumPy, and overview of data types in Awkward Array.

**0:20-0:40 (20 min):** Walk-through of exploratory data analysis (EDM) with the GeoJSON dataset. First with ufuncs and slices, then with Numba.

**0:40-1:00 (20 min):** All together (I ask questions, get responses in chat): exploratory analysis of the Exoplanets dataset.

**1:00-1:10 (10 min):** _(break)_

**1:10-1:30 (20 min):** Dealing with large scale data: LHC mass peaks (including Higgs discovery).

**1:30-1:50 (20 min):** All together: lazy-loading the Argo Floats dataset, doing some non-trivial manipulations.

**1:50-2:00 (10 min):** _(break)_

**2:00-2:10 (10 min):** Introduction to the Million Song dataset and sample project questions.

**2:10-3:30 (1 hour, 20 min):** Small groups work on their chosen Million Song projects.

**3:30-4:00 (30 min):** Each group informally demonstrates what they've accomplished.
